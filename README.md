# Fast Dense Feature Extraction for CNNs

A Pytorch implemention of the paper *Fast Dense Feature Extraction with CNNs
that have Pooling or Striding Layers*
 .
## Getting Started

These instructions will explain how to use the FDFE project.
### Prerequisites
* Python>=3.5
* pytorch>=1.0
* numpy
* matplotlib

### Installing

1) Install all prerequisites.
2) Clone the project

## Project Structure


* ```FDFE.py``` - implementation of the layers multipool,multiconv,unwarping and preparation described in the paper.
* ```BaseNet.py``` - 

## Running the tests

Now you should run tests to make sure that FDFE project works correctly.

### Possible arguments
```
batch_size - dasd
img_size -adasdsa
..dasd
```

```
python test.example

```

Expected output

```

```
